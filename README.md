# HR Analytics on Employee and Salary Structure
The dataset of an HR department in a certain company. Microsoft Excel was the only tool for analysing and visualising this data.
The dataset contained 742 rows and 7 columns. 
The columns include Employee Name, Department of Employee, Hire Date, Employment Type, Benefit Type, Salary, and Employee Rating. These are the records of the employees from 2004 to 2019.

## Analysis & Insights
* I used Excel functions and Defined Tables for the Analysis. Functions used include Sum, Sumifs, Count, Countifs, and Averageifs.
* The Total Salary/compensation that has been paid to the employees from 2004 to 2019 is 47,928,375.
* From 2004 to 2019 there have been 741 employees employed in the company which include both males and females.
* The Average Salary an employee earned was 64,681.
* Out of the total of 741 employees, 374 were Full Time, 126 were contracted, 120 were Half-Time and 121 were Hourly Employees.
* There were 21 departments; Manufacturing, Quality Control, Account Mgt., Quality Assurance and Facilities/ Engineering were the top 5 departments with the highest number of employees.
* The employees in the Environmental Compliance and Manufacturing Admin received the highest average salaries.
* Employees on Full Time received more than 50% of the total salary paid which amounted to 34,544,280.
* This is the trend of the number of Staff the company employed from 2004 to 2019. The years 2013 and 2016 recorded the highest number of employees while 2004 and 2019 recorded the least number of employees.

# Recommendations
* The benefits package of the benefit types “DR” and “D” should be revised to attract more employees.
* There was a massive drop in the number of employees in the company. A root cause analysis needs to be carried out to find out the cause of the sudden drop in the number of employees from 2016 to 2019.
